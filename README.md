**`Developer/Creator/Artist`**

I'm a self made Frontend Developer and Designer creating seamless user experiences and software solutions one step at a time. All my coding projects have been built from the ground up, from designing complex UI to converting them into code. I have created a portfolio website myself which showcases some of the work i have done. You can visit: <a href="https://sambabu.netlify.app/">sambabu.dev</a>
